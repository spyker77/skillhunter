SkillHunter is all about helping you and your mates identify the most in-demand skills in the job market in order to find a new position as soon as possible. Cut the bullshit and prepare yourself in the most efficient way, no need to learn everything!

What if you asked yourself the wrong question: "What do I need to learn?" Whereas a better one could be: "What I don't need to learn?" The latter helps you save a ton of time by avoiding unnecessary work when time is the most valuable ‚Äì at the very beginning of unknown ‚Äì that's where the SkillHunter really shines.

## Installation

Download this project and run [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spyker77/skillhunter.git
cd skillhunter
```

## Usage

Update environment variables inside the docker-compose.yml and run the following bash commands inside downloaded project's folder ‚Äì this will launch the process of building the image (if it doesn't exist), create and start containers in a detached mode.

1. Due to a forced HTTPS in production, it might be a good idea to start with **ENVIRONMENT=development** in .env file ‚Äì this will allow you to avoid SSL related errors.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

2. On the first run you need to apply migrations to the fresh database:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

3. Load the job titles to parse and skills to identify:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py loaddata jobs.json skills.json
```

4. [Optional] Run scrapers to collect initial data on available vacancies:

```bash
docker compose exec worker python manage.py scrape_hh
docker compose exec worker python manage.py scrape_indeed
docker compose exec worker python manage.py scrape_sh
```

...or run scrapers periodically using **cron** and additionally cleaning the database from outdated records:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py purge_db
```

**Tada** üéâ

By now you should be up and running. Try to reach the <http://localhost> in your browser.

In order to prepopulate the database, you can use the test data:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py loaddata scrapers_vacancy.json scrapers_vacancy_part_1.json scrapers_vacancy_part_2.json scrapers_vacancy_part_3.json
```

In order to run tests:

```bash
docker compose exec -e DB_HOST=db web pytest -n auto --cov="."
```

**Note** ‚ö†Ô∏è

For the local development you may need to install **poppler** (e.g. using `brew install poppler`) for the **pdftotext** package, and **pg_config** for the **psycopg** (e.g. using `brew install postgresql`).
